## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above  
- Common ML libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```
- Jupyter Notebook (if you want to run `.ipynb` files):  
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```

### Running Examples
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devjith-P/Machine-Learning.git
   cd Machine-Learning
   ```
2. Navigate to any folder (e.g. `Linear Regression/`)  
3. Open the notebook with:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Or run the Python file directly:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

5. To run the test script:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```
